# DSA-Java Repository

This repository contains Java implementations for various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). The goal of this repository is to provide well-documented and clean code for commonly used algorithms and data structures, following best practices for Java development.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into different folders based on the data structures and algorithms. Here is the structure:


- **Striver_sheet**: This folder contains solutions from Striver's DSA Sheet.
  - **Sorting_Algorithms**: Java implementations for sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
  - **Arrays**: Implementations of various array-related problems.
  - **Binary_Trees**: Implementations of binary tree problems, including traversal algorithms.

## Files Included

1. **.gitignore**:
   - This file is used to ignore unnecessary files such as `.DS_Store` on macOS.

2. **Java Files**:
   - All Java files related to data structure implementations are located inside the respective subfolders.

## Setup and Usage

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed:

- Java 11 or higher
- Git (for cloning the repository)

### Contributions
